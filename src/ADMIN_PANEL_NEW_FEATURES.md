## 🔄 How It Works Technically

### Image Upload Flow:
```
1. You select/drag/paste image
   ↓
2. Image is validated (type, size)
   ↓
3. Uploaded to Supabase Storage bucket
   ↓
4. Public URL is generated
   ↓
5. URL is saved in project data
   ↓
6. Image displays on portfolio
```

### Data Storage:
- **Project metadata** → Supabase KV Store
- **Images** → Supabase Storage (CDN)
- **Rich text** → HTML string in database
- **Comments** → Separate table

### Connected vs Local Mode:
- **Connected** (Green) → Saves to Supabase (persistent)

Always ensure you see **"Connected"** before saving important work!
