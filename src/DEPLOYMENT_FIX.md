# ðŸ”§ Deployment Error Fixed

## The Problem

Figma Make was trying to auto-deploy your Edge Function and getting a **403 Forbidden** error because it doesn't have deployment permissions for your Supabase project.

## The Solution

âœ… **Manual deployment via Supabase CLI** (which you're already doing successfully!)

The `.figmaignore` file has been added to prevent Figma Make from trying to auto-deploy the `supabase/` folder.

---

## How to Deploy Changes

Whenever you make changes to the Edge Function (`/supabase/functions/server/index.tsx`), deploy manually:

```bash
supabase functions deploy server --project-ref qiaichppehdzfhyvneoy
```

That's it! âœ¨

---

## Current Status

Your Edge Function is **already deployed and working** at:

```
https://qiaichppehdzfhyvneoy.supabase.co/functions/v1/server
```

All frontend code has been updated to use this endpoint.

---

## What's Working Now

âœ… All API endpoints updated to `/server`  
âœ… Edge Function routes cleaned up (no more `make-server-583db2fc` prefix)  
âœ… Frontend code matches deployed function  
âœ… Figma Make won't try to auto-deploy anymore  

---

## Next Steps

1. **Create the storage bucket** (if you haven't already):
   - Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qiaichppehdzfhyvneoy/storage/buckets
   - Create bucket named: `project-images`
   - Make it **public** âœ…

2. **Test your admin panel**:
   - Open portfolio and add `#admin` to URL
   - Login with your credentials
   - Upload an image - it should work!

3. **If you make changes to the Edge Function**, just redeploy:
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy server --project-ref qiaichppehdzfhyvneoy
   ```

---

## Why Manual Deployment?

Figma Make doesn't have write access to your Supabase project (for security reasons). This is actually **safer** - you have full control over what gets deployed to your Supabase backend.

Your frontend code can still be edited in Figma Make - only the backend function needs manual deployment.

---

## Pro Tip

You can check if your function is deployed and healthy:

```bash
curl https://qiaichppehdzfhyvneoy.supabase.co/functions/v1/server/health
```

Should return: `{"status":"ok"}` âœ…

You're all set! The 403 error won't happen anymore. ðŸŽ‰
