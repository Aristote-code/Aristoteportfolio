# Supabase Storage Setup for Image Uploads

Your admin panel now supports proper image uploads! Follow these steps to enable image storage in Supabase.

## Step 1: Create Storage Bucket

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qiaichppehdzfhyvneoy
2. Click on **Storage** in the left sidebar
3. Click **Create a new bucket**
4. Configure the bucket:
   - **Name:** `project-images`
   - **Public bucket:** ‚úÖ **YES** (check this box)
   - **File size limit:** 5MB (or your preference)
   - **Allowed MIME types:** Leave empty or add: `image/png, image/jpeg, image/jpg, image/gif, image/webp`
5. Click **Create bucket**

## Step 2: Set Storage Policies (Public Access)

Since you checked "Public bucket", images will be publicly accessible by default. If you need to configure custom policies:

1. Go to **Storage** ‚Üí **Policies**
2. For the `project-images` bucket, ensure these policies exist:

### Policy 1: Public Read Access
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Public read access"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'project-images');
```

### Policy 2: Authenticated Upload
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated upload"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO public
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'project-images');
```

### Policy 3: Authenticated Delete (Optional)
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated delete"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'project-images');
```

## Step 3: Verify Setup

1. Go to your portfolio admin panel: `#admin`
2. Create or edit a project
3. Try uploading an image in the **Cover Image** section
4. You should see the upload progress and the image should appear

## Step 4: Test All Upload Methods

Your image upload component supports three methods:

### 1. Click to Browse
- Click on the upload area
- Select an image from your computer
- Image will upload automatically

### 2. Drag & Drop
- Drag an image file from your desktop
- Drop it onto the upload area
- Image will upload automatically

### 3. Copy & Paste
- Copy an image (from anywhere - screenshot, browser, etc.)
- Click on any input field in the admin panel
- Press `Ctrl+V` (Windows) or `Cmd+V` (Mac)
- Image will upload automatically

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to upload image" Error

**Check bucket name:**
- Ensure the bucket is named exactly `project-images`
- Check spelling and case sensitivity

**Check bucket is public:**
- Go to Storage ‚Üí project-images ‚Üí Settings
- Ensure "Public bucket" is checked

**Check storage policies:**
- Go to Storage ‚Üí Policies
- Ensure public read and insert policies exist

### Images Upload But Don't Display

**Check public URL:**
- Go to Storage ‚Üí project-images
- Click on an uploaded image
- Click "Get URL" - it should work without authentication

**Check CORS:**
- The Edge Function already handles CORS
- If issues persist, check browser console for errors

### "Storage bucket not found" Error

- The bucket doesn't exist yet
- Follow Step 1 above to create it
- Redeploy your Edge Function after creating the bucket

## Image Management

### View All Uploaded Images
1. Go to **Storage** ‚Üí **project-images**
2. You'll see all uploaded images
3. You can:
   - Download images
   - Delete unused images
   - Get public URLs
   - Copy URLs

### Delete Unused Images
To keep your storage clean:
1. Go to Storage ‚Üí project-images
2. Select images you want to delete
3. Click **Delete**

### Storage Limits
- **Free tier:** 1GB storage
- **Pro tier:** 100GB storage
- Monitor usage in Dashboard ‚Üí Storage

## Security Notes

‚úÖ **Public bucket is safe** because:
- Images are meant to be public (portfolio)
- Upload requires authentication via admin panel
- Only admin can upload via the Edge Function
- Public can only read (view) images

‚ùå **Don't store sensitive data** in this bucket

## Next Steps

Once storage is set up:
1. ‚úÖ Upload project cover images
2. ‚úÖ Add image blocks to project content
3. ‚úÖ Drag, drop, or paste images anywhere
4. ‚úÖ All images stored permanently in Supabase

Your portfolio now has a professional image management system! üé®
