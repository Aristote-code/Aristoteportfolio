# 🔧 Email Fix & Admin Panel Guide

**Date:** October 22, 2025 at 9:18 PM UTC+2  
**Status:** Admin ✅ Working | Emails ⚠️ Needs API Key

---

## ⚠️ EMAIL ISSUE FOUND

### The Problem
Your **Resend API key is invalid**. That's why you're not receiving emails.

**Error from Resend API:**
```json
{
  "statusCode": 401,
  "name": "validation_error",
  "message": "API key is invalid"
}
```

### The Solution: Get a Valid Resend API Key

#### Step 1: Sign up for Resend (Free)
1. Go to: https://resend.com/
2. Click "Sign Up" (it's free)
3. Verify your email

#### Step 2: Get Your API Key
1. Log in to Resend dashboard
2. Go to **API Keys** section
3. Click **"Create API Key"**
4. Give it a name like: "Portfolio Email Notifications"
5. Select permissions: **"Sending access"**
6. Click **"Add"**
7. **Copy the API key** (it starts with `re_`)

**IMPORTANT:** Save this key somewhere safe! You can only see it once.

#### Step 3: Configure in Supabase
```bash
# Set the Resend API key in Supabase
supabase secrets set RESEND_API_KEY="re_your_actual_api_key_here"
```

Replace `re_your_actual_api_key_here` with your real Resend API key.

#### Step 4: Verify Domain (Optional but Recommended)
For production use, verify your domain in Resend:
1. In Resend dashboard → Go to **Domains**
2. Click **"Add Domain"**
3. Follow instructions to add DNS records
4. Once verified, update the "from" email in your code

**Current from address:** `onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend's test domain)  
**Future from address:** `notifications@yourdomain.com` (your verified domain)

supabase functions logs server

# Or check in Supabase Dashboard:

```

Look for:
