### 2. 👥 Real-Time Collaborative Cursors (Figma-style) ✅

**Working exactly like Figma/FigJam:**

#### Features:
- ✅ **See other users in real-time** as they move their mouse
- ✅ **Ultra-smooth animations** (100 updates/second, 10ms throttle)
- ✅ **Figma-like spring physics** (damping: 20, stiffness: 800)
- ✅ **User names displayed** next to each cursor
- ✅ **Unique colors** for each user
- ✅ **Inactivity timeout:** Users disappear after **60 seconds (1 minute)** of no movement ✅ **(UPDATED)**
- ✅ **Automatic cleanup** of stale cursors
- ✅ **Works across all pages** of your portfolio

#### Technical Details:
- **Technology:** Supabase Realtime Presence

- **Animation:** Motion/Framer Motion spring physics
- **Inactivity Timeout:** 60 seconds (1 minute) ✅ **(NEW)**

#### How It Works:
1. User moves mouse → Position broadcast via Supabase Realtime

5. When user moves again → Cursor reappears instantly
