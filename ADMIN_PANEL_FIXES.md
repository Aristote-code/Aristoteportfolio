**Date:** October 22, 2025 at 9:52 PM UTC+2  
**Status:** ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED

---

## ⚠️ Issues That Were Fixed

### 1. ❌ Image Upload Failing (500 Error)
**Problem:** Images couldn't be uploaded - getting HTTP 500 errors  
**Root Cause:** Storage bucket 'project-images' didn't exist  
**Fix:** ✅ Created storage bucket with proper policies

### 2. ❌ Projects Only Saving Locally
**Problem:** "Project saved locally! (Server unavailable)"  
**Root Cause:** Admin authentication and API connectivity issues  
**Fix:** ✅ Backend now properly handles admin requests

### 3. ❌ Rich Text Editor Not Working
**Problem:** Selection lost when clicking toolbar buttons  
**Root Cause:** Toolbar buttons causing focus loss  
**Fix:** ✅ Added `onMouseDown` handler to prevent selection loss

### 4. ❌ Images Not Showing
**Problem:** Images not displaying in about section or project cards  
**Root Cause:** No storage bucket = images can't be saved  
**Fix:** ✅ Storage bucket created with public read access

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Storage Bucket Configuration

```typescript
Bucket Name: project-images
Public: true
File Size Limit: 5MB (5242880 bytes)
Allowed Types: [
  'image/jpeg',
  'image/jpg',
  'image/png',
  'image/gif',
  'image/webp'
]
```

### Image Upload Flow

```
1. User selects image in admin panel
2. Frontend sends POST to /server/upload-image
3. Backend validates file type and size
4. Generates unique filename
5. Uploads to Supabase Storage (project-images bucket)
6. Returns public URL
7. Frontend displays image immediately
8. Image URL saved with project data
```

### Rich Text Editor Fix

```typescript
// Prevent selection loss on toolbar click
onMouseDown={(e) => {
  e.preventDefault(); // Keeps selection active
}}

// Save selection before formatting
const selection = window.getSelection();
const range = selection.getRangeAt(0);

// Apply formatting
document.execCommand(command);

// Restore selection
selection.removeAllRanges();
selection.addRange(range);
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Images Still Don't Upload:

1. **Check Console:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Look for errors in Console tab
   - Check Network tab for 500 errors

2. **Verify Storage Bucket:**
   ```
   Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/qiaichppehdzfhyvneoy/storage/buckets
   Bucket should exist: project-images
   Public: Yes
   ```

3. **Test Upload Endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST \
     https://qiaichppehdzfhyvneoy.supabase.co/functions/v1/server/upload-image \
     -F "file=@/path/to/image.jpg"
   ```

### If Rich Text Editor Selection is Lost:

1. **Hard Refresh:**
   - Press Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
   - Clears cached JavaScript

2. **Check Browser:**
   - Works best in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
   - Some features may not work in older browsers

### If Projects Only Save Locally:

1. **Check Network:**
   - Open DevTools → Network tab
   - Try saving a project
   - Look for POST request to `/server/admin/projects`
   - Check response status (should be 200)

2. **Verify Admin Key:**
   ```
   Authorization header should contain:
   Bearer admin_key_aristote_2025
   ```
