## ⚠️ Important Notes

### 1. Comment Posting
Comments **will not work yet** until you deploy the backend CORS fixes to Supabase:
```bash
./deploy-backend-fix.sh
```

### 2. CORS Configuration
The frontend is deployed, but the backend still needs the CORS fix deployed to accept requests from this new URL.

### 3. DNS/Domain
If you have a custom domain, configure it in Vercel dashboard:
- Go to Project Settings → Domains
- Add your custom domain
- Update DNS records as instructed
